## 1. Case Study: The 2023 Aliquippa Cyberattack

The [attack on a Pennsylvania water station](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/30/exposed-and-vulnerable-recent-attacks-highlight-critical-need-to-protect-internet-exposed-ot-devices/) by the group **Cyber Av3ngers** serves as a critical alert for the vulnerability of internet-facing **Operational Technology (OT).**

The incident highlights how legacy OT interacts with cyber threats and the need for new security professionals adapted to go beyond traditional defense methods.

* **The Breach:** Exploit of default credentials on PLCs.

* **The Solution:** Implementation of a unified IT/OT posture using tools like **[Microsoft Defender for IoT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-iot/).**
